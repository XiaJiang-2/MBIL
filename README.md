## MBIL Algorithm

## Explanation of MBIL Algorithm
1) determine_single_predictors learns the set PA1 of single-variable risk factors of a target T. The procedure does this by determining whether the BDeu score of the model in which the variable has an edge to T is greater than the BDeu score of the model in which T has no parents.

Example of BDeu Score
Chuhan finish
####score_abs is the kind of like tha abstract class to finish basic calculation work which can be reused by other function in the future
####search_test_object is the class to do the final search according to calculation result from score_abs class
