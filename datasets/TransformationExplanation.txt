B	C	D	E
2	1	0	0
3	1	1	1
3	0	1	0
3	0	1	1
2	1	2	0

If B, C, D are interacting, then we can transform them into a new feature called F, wh0ich should contain 12 different values, as mapped below:
0: 2, 0, 0
1: 3, 0, 0
2: 2, 1, 0
3: 3, 1, 0
4: 3, 1, 1
...
11: 3, 1, 2

Once F is created, then the dataset will look like this:

B	C	D	F	E
2	1	0	2	0
3	1	1	4	1
3	0	1	?	0
3	0	1	?	1
2	1	2	?	0
